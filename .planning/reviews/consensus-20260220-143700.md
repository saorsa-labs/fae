## Findings by Severity

### CRITICAL (0 findings)
None.

### HIGH (0 findings)
None.

### MEDIUM (0 findings)
None.

### LOW / SHOULD CONSIDER (2 findings, 1-2 votes each)

1. **EndpointType::requires_base_url() helper** [1 vote: code-simplifier]
   - Current validate_config checks `provider.endpoint_type != EndpointType::Local` inline
   - Could encapsulate in an EndpointType method for clarity
   - Not blocking; pure optional refactor

2. **Test fixture uses 'openai' endpoint_type** [1 vote: minimax]
   - setup_config_with_comments() in integration tests uses OpenAI config as fixture
   - Tests generic TOML parsing, not OpenAI provider — acceptable
   - Not blocking; acknowledged

---

## Consensus Verdict

**PASS — No blocking findings**

All 15 reviewers voted PASS. Zero CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM findings.
Build fully green: fmt, clippy, nextest all pass.

## Summary

Phase 6.1b successfully removed all non-embedded LLM provider code:
- Deleted ~4000+ lines of provider code (OpenAI, Anthropic, SSE, fallback, local_probe, profile)
- Deleted 2 contract test files
- Updated config defaults to local-only
- Fixed validation for local endpoint (no base_url required)
- Cleaned credential doc examples and diagnostics account list
- All 4 tasks from the plan completed
- 2159 tests pass, 0 failures

The codebase is in excellent shape. The embedded-only architecture is now correctly reflected
in all code, documentation, tests, and configuration.
