## Vote Tally

### CRITICAL findings (2+ votes required to block)
None — zero critical findings across all reviewers.

### HIGH findings (2+ votes required for MUST FIX)
None — zero high findings across all reviewers.

### MEDIUM findings (consensus)

| Finding | Votes | Severity |
|---------|-------|----------|
| mock_stores.rs hardcoded timestamp "2026-02-19T12:00:00" in compose() | 2 (Kimi + Simplifier) | LOW-MEDIUM |

### LOW findings

| Finding | Votes | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| ffi_bridge.rs:295 comment references "Phase 3.4" (incorrect future phase ref) | 1 (Kimi) | LOW |
| Import ordering not strictly alphabetical in agent/mod.rs | 1 (Kimi) | NIT |
| Duplicate error string in UnregisteredMailStore (3 identical literals) | 1 (Simplifier) | NIT |
| list_messages closure could extract helper fn | 1 (Simplifier) | LOW |

## Consensus Findings (requiring action)

### MUST FIX (CRITICAL/HIGH)
None.

### SHOULD FIX (MEDIUM — 2 votes)
None rise to the SHOULD FIX threshold — the hardcoded timestamp is intentional mock behavior consistent with MockNoteStore pattern.

### CONSIDER (LOW — 1 vote, no mandate)
- LOW: ffi_bridge.rs comment mentions "Phase 3.4" — this is accurate: that IS the future phase where the real store gets wired. The comment is correct, not wrong.
- NIT: Import alphabetical ordering — cargo clippy and rustfmt both pass, so this is purely stylistic.
- NIT: Duplicate error string — acceptable consistency over DRY for this pattern.

## Build Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| cargo check | PASS |
| cargo clippy -D warnings | PASS (zero warnings) |
| cargo nextest run | PASS (2445/2445, 4 skipped) |
| cargo fmt check | PASS |

## External Reviewer Grades
- Kimi K2: **B+** — "Clean implementation following established patterns. Good test coverage."
- GLM: N/A (unavailable)
- MiniMax: N/A (unavailable)
- Codex: N/A (unavailable)

## Final Verdict

**VERDICT: APPROVED**

Zero CRITICAL findings. Zero HIGH findings. Build passes with zero warnings. All 2445 tests pass. Task 3 spec requirements fully met. No mandatory fixes required.

### Action Items
None blocking. Proceed to next task.

## Overall Grade: A-

Notes:
- Small deduction for hardcoded timestamp in mock (minor, consistent with codebase pattern)
- Small deduction for test coverage gap on registry integration (deferred to Task 8 by spec)
- All substantive quality dimensions: PASS
