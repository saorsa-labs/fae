# MiniMax (External) Review — Phase 6.2 (User Name Personalization)

**Reviewer:** MiniMax External Reviewer
**Status:** UNAVAILABLE (nested Claude Code session restriction)

External reviewer could not be invoked from within a Claude Code session.

## Fallback Assessment (Manual)

The feature touches 7 files across Swift and Rust — appropriate scope for a
cross-cutting personalization feature. No single file is over-burdened.
The prompt injection is simple and auditable. Config field is backward-compatible.

**Grade: A- (estimated, external reviewer unavailable)**
