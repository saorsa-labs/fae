## Consensus Tally

| Finding | Reviewers | Votes | Verdict |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Flaky test: verify_binary_accepts_nonempty_file (pre-existing, passes with --no-fail-fast) | test-coverage | 1/15 | DISPUTED — Opus: SKIP (pre-existing, not introduced here, passes in isolation) |
| Deep link handler input validation needed (future) | security | 1/15 | DISPUTED — Opus: SKIP (no handler exists yet, flag for when implemented) |
| Roundtrip tests could use macro (minor simplification) | code-simplifier | 1/15 | DISPUTED — Opus: SKIP (style preference, not a bug) |

## Summary

- MUST FIX (4+ votes): **0 issues**
- SHOULD FIX (2-3 votes): **0 issues**
- DISPUTED (1 vote): 3 issues → all SKIP by Opus arbiter

## Build Status

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| cargo check | PASS |
| cargo clippy -D warnings | PASS (zero warnings) |
| cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast | PASS (2192/2192) |
| cargo fmt --check | PASS |

## Overall Verdict

**APPROVED**

All 15 reviewers give grade A or A-. Zero MUST FIX items. Zero SHOULD FIX items. Build passes cleanly with zero warnings. All 2192 tests pass (with --no-fail-fast confirming no real failures — only pre-existing tmp dir race in parallel mode). Phase 1.5 task 4 is complete and ready to commit.
