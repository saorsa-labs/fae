## Voting Tally

| Finding | Agent Votes | Severity | Action |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Phase name mismatch: STATE.json vs PLAN-phase-4.1.md | task-spec(1) | HIGH | MUST FIX |
| Pre-existing doc warnings (broken intra-doc links) | documentation(1), build(1) | MEDIUM | SHOULD FIX |
| gui.rs is 11,225 lines (complexity) | complexity(1) | LOW | WATCH |
| mold linker path hardcoded to ZeroBrew | security(1), kimi(1) | LOW | INFORMATIONAL |
| `.unwrap()`/`panic!` in test code only | error-handling(1) | OK | NO ACTION |
| All 2490 tests pass | test-coverage(1), build(1) | OK | NO ACTION |
| Zero clippy warnings | build(1) | OK | NO ACTION |
| Zero fmt violations | build(1) | OK | NO ACTION |

## Findings with 2+ Votes

### FINDING-1: Phase name mismatch [HIGH — 1 vote]
**Status**: Metadata inconsistency only — not a code issue.
STATE.json says phase 4.1 is "Glassmorphic Design & Separate Window" but
PLAN-phase-4.1.md says "Tracing, Metrics & Redaction". This is likely because
STATE.json was updated for the new milestone scope while the plan file was written
for a different scope. No code fix needed — STATE.json may need updating or the
plan file may be from an earlier planning iteration.

**Note**: Only 1 agent voted on this finding. Below the 2-vote threshold for mandatory fix.

### FINDING-2: Pre-existing documentation warnings [MEDIUM — 2 votes]
**Files**:
- src/fae_llm/tools/apple/availability_gate.rs:18 — unresolved `with_jit_channel`
- src/linker_anchor.rs:10 — unresolved `PipelineCoordinator`, `ParakeetStt`, `KokoroTts`, `LocalLlm`
- src/pipeline/coordinator.rs:382 — unresolved `SharedPermissionStore`
- src/pipeline/coordinator.rs — `public doc links to private item 'JIT_TIMEOUT'`

**Votes**: documentation(1), build(1) = 2 votes — SHOULD FIX threshold met.
**Note**: These are pre-existing baseline issues, not introduced by this phase diff.
They exist in the codebase and violate zero-doc-warnings policy.

## Summary Grades

| Reviewer | Grade |
|----------|-------|
| Error Handling | A |
| Security | A |
| Code Quality | A- |
| Documentation | B (pre-existing doc warnings) |
| Test Coverage | A |
| Type Safety | A |
| Complexity | B (pre-existing gui.rs size) |
| Build Validator | A |
| Task Assessor | C (phase name mismatch, 0 tasks started) |
| Quality Patterns | A |
| Codex | N/A (CLI interface error) |
| Kimi K2 | B (incomplete) |
| GLM | N/A (unavailable) |
| MiniMax | N/A (unavailable) |
| Code Simplifier | A |

**Overall Consensus Grade: A- (build quality excellent; pre-existing doc warnings and phase metadata mismatch noted)**

---

## Decision: PASS

**Exit conditions met:**
- [x] Zero CRITICAL findings
- [x] Zero HIGH findings with 2+ votes (phase name mismatch is metadata, 1 vote only)
- [x] Build passes: cargo check + clippy + nextest + fmt all PASS
- [x] External grades: Kimi B (threshold met), others N/A

**Action Required Before Phase Execution:**
1. Clarify the phase name discrepancy between STATE.json and PLAN-phase-4.1.md
2. Fix the 4 broken intra-doc links in a future pass (existing technical debt)

**Review Status: PASSED — Phase 4.1 ready to begin task execution**
