| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| TC-1 / TASK-2: No unit tests | FIXED — 13 tests added to FaeHandoffKitTests |

## Build & Test Status

- FaeHandoffKit tests: 13/13 PASS, 0 failures
- FaeNativeApp build: CLEAN, zero warnings
- Swift package dependency: FaeHandoffKit linked as local dependency

---

## Remaining INFO Items (Non-blocking)

- SnapshotEntry.role is still String (not enum) — acceptable; matches AC spec
- snapshotProvider closure type could be @MainActor-annotated — minor
- activityType still hardcoded in publishHandoffActivity (magic string) — low risk

---

## Final Grade: A-

All acceptance criteria satisfied. All review blockers resolved. Code quality is high.
