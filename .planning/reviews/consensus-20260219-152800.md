## VERDICT: PASS

## All Blocking Issues from Iteration 1: RESOLVED

| Finding | Iteration 1 | Iteration 2 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `ControlEvent` non-exhaustive match (E0004) | CRITICAL / 15 votes | RESOLVED |
| Missing acceptance-criterion tests | HIGH / 12 votes | RESOLVED |

---

## Vote Tally — Remaining Items

| Finding | Votes | Severity | Action |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| `run_sysctl_u64` spawns subprocess | 4/15 | LOW | INFO (future refactor) |
| `mp_bridge_jh` dropped without tracking | 3/15 | LOW | INFO |
| `request_runtime_start` method length | 3/15 | LOW | INFO |
| Restart counter read duplicated in watcher | 2/15 | LOW | INFO |
| Memory pressure bridge as inline block | 2/15 | LOW | INFO |

No findings reach the 6-vote threshold for SHOULD FIX. All carry-overs are LOW severity
(under 5 votes each). Exit conditions met.

## Exit Conditions — ALL MET

- [x] Zero CRITICAL findings
- [x] Zero HIGH findings
- [x] Build passes (cargo check + clippy + fmt + nextest: 2551/2551)
- [x] All external grades B or higher (Codex=A-, Kimi=A-, GLM=A-, MiniMax=A-)

## Task Assessment: PASS

All 8 acceptance criteria for Phase 5.2 Task 1 now pass:
1. Restart policy (5 attempts, [1,2,4,8,16]s backoff) — PASS
2. Watcher monitors pipeline exit — PASS
3. Unexpected exit: state update + event emission — PASS
4. Clean stop: no restart triggered — PASS
5. `pipeline.control` `auto_restart` event — PASS
6. Backoff reset on stable run > 30s — PASS
7. `restart_count` + `last_restart_at` state fields — PASS
8. Tests: restart emits event + clean stop safe — PASS (FIXED)

Tasks 2 (model integrity), 3 (audio device hot-swap), 4 (network resilience) also
fully implemented with tests.
