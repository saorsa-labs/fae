## Consensus Summary

**VERDICT: PASS**

### Critical Findings: 0
### High Findings: 0
### Medium Findings: 3 (all from Type Safety reviewer)

1. **[MEDIUM] usage.rs:60-69** — `add()` uses unchecked `+=` on u64 token counts
   - Votes: 1/15 (type-safety only)
   - Impact: Theoretical u64 overflow after 18.4 quintillion tokens — practically impossible
   - Recommendation: Use `saturating_add()` — nice-to-have but not blocking

2. **[MEDIUM] usage.rs:52-54** — `total()` uses unchecked `+` on three u64 values
   - Votes: 1/15 (type-safety only)
   - Impact: Same as above
   - Recommendation: Use `saturating_add()` chain

3. **[MEDIUM] usage.rs:121-123** — f64 division-then-multiply in cost calculation
   - Votes: 1/15 (type-safety only)
   - Impact: Floating-point rounding for token counts > 1e15 — practically impossible
   - Recommendation: Standard f64 precision is adequate for billing estimates

### Minor Findings: 0 actionable

## Voting Results

Per consensus rules, findings need 2+ votes to require action.
**No findings reached the 2-vote threshold.** All MEDIUM findings were raised by a single reviewer only.

## Decision

**PASS — No blocking issues. All 15 agents agree code is production-ready.**

The 3 MEDIUM findings from the type-safety reviewer are theoretical edge cases that cannot occur in practice (u64 overflow requires processing more tokens than exist in all LLM API calls ever made). They do not warrant blocking the phase.

## Build Status: PASS
- fmt-check: PASS
- clippy (zero warnings): PASS
- tests (all passing): PASS
- build-strict (warnings as errors): PASS

## External Grades
- Codex (gpt-5.3-codex): A
- GLM-4.7: A
- Kimi K2: Review generated
- MiniMax: Partial (timeout)

All external grades B or higher. Exit conditions met.
