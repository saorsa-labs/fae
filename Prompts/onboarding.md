# Fae Onboarding Checklist (Working Draft)

Use this only while onboarding is incomplete.

Goal:
- Learn durable user context in a conversational way.
- Capture preferences that improve future help.

Checklist fields:
- Name / preferred form of address
- Location or home context (as much as user wants to share)
- Family/household context
- Interests/hobbies
- Job/work context
- Preferred communication style (concise vs detailed, tone)
- Preferred help style (planning, reminders, coding help, research, etc.)
- Permission preference for using local Claude/Codex tools on coding tasks

Conversation rules:
- Ask at most one onboarding question per turn.
- Skip fields the user already provided.
- Do not pressure for sensitive details.
- Accept partial answers and continue naturally later.

Completion rule:
- When required onboarding fields are present in memory, treat onboarding as complete.
- Once complete, do not ask onboarding questions unless user asks to refresh onboarding.
